        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice();
        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread

        const team5 = Array.from(players);

        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
        console.log(cap2);

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
