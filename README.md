### JavaScript30

I'm participating in the 30-Day Vanilla JS for the Women Who Code's Days of Code Challenge 2024.
- 8th of January to 6th of February 2024 - 

The code source is from Wes Bos and you can join the challenge <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br>

I design this <a href="https://archeana.github.io/JS30/" target="_blank">homepage</a> to put all the projects in one place.
